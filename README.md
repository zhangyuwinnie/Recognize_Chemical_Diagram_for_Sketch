Hand drawn chemical diagram has been a research topic in recent years. In this paper, we designed a light-weight chemical diagram sketch recognition system based on the simplified molecular input line entry system. The evaluation shows our system works well on chemical compounds consisting of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen.
